## Postman Test Generator

Is a tool to help you generate your own postman test runner. Based on our old postman gist [here](https://gist.github.com/sakadigital/5598630f6d9e439dcc6f5287a43b2da2)

This is a lite version of the original postman test generator. All authentication, project and saving feature is removed. It also doesn't need any database and you only need provide basic laravel .env such as:

```
APP_ENV=local
APP_KEY=base64:Vpqb8dupns+qjWH72LyNAmcye3zHCYD+2ZtQp63mMs4=
APP_DEBUG=true
APP_LOG_LEVEL=debug
APP_URL=http://localhost
```
